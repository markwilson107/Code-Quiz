# Code Quiz - Mark Wilson

For this project I have created a quiz game on the subject of javascript fundamentals. It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Bootstrap was used for the UI.
The play has 60 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. If an answer is incorrect 5 seconds are deducted.
Highscore are stored in local storage and displayed when the user opens the highscore page.
